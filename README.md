## Work with AI

| Metric | 24h | 7 Days | 28 Days | 365 Days |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Screen time (Mac) | 0h | 0h | 0h | ~0h* |
| User AI session hours | 2.8h | 35.5h | 60.9h | 60.9h |
| AI worker hours | 0.0h | 0.0h | 0.0h | 0.0h |
| AI concurrency hours | 3.0h | 45.0h | 74.3h | 74.3h |
| Interactive sessions | 5 | 12 | 73 | 73 |
| Worker sessions | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |

_Screen time from macOS display events, snapshotted daily. *365-day extrapolated (accumulating real data)._

_User AI session hours measured from AI message timestamps (reading, thinking, typing between responses)._

## AI Model Usage (last 30 days)

| Model | Requests | Input | Output | Cache read | API Cost | Cache savings | Model savings |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |

| claude-sonnet-4-6 | 10,544 | 10K | 3.4M | 596.8M | $289.19 | $1,611.55 | $921.85 |
| claude-opus-4-5 | 120 | 2 | 46K | 10.6M | $21.83 | $143.12 | $0.00 |
| moonshotai/kimi-k2 | 12 | 405K | 550 | 0 | $1.23 | $0.00 | $6.13 |
| **Total** | **16,948** | **426K** | **6.0M** | **1,393.1M** | **$2,769.63** | **$12,361.78** | **$927.98** |

_1,473.2M total tokens processed. 94.6% cache hit rate._

_$13,289.77 total saved ($12,361.78 caching + $927.98 model routing vs all-Opus)._

_Model savings are modest because ~94.6% of tokens are cache reads, where price differences between models are small._
